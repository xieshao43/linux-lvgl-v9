CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/ABYDOS/Desktop/工具集/githublibrary/quark_lvgl_9.0/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /quark_lvgl_9.0/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "C:/Users/ABYDOS/Desktop/工具集/githublibrary/quark_lvgl_9.0/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/quark_lvgl_9.0/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
